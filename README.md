# Hi, I'm Mohammad Mahdi 👋

## ❌ Not Really Here

### ⚠️ While you're reading this on GitHub, this isn't my real playground.

### My main and original development happens elsewhere — where I actually build things, break things, and sometimes fix them:

- ### 🧪 **GitLab (main public hub)**: [gitlab.com/mahdium](https://gitlab.com/mahdium)
- ### 🛠️ **Self-hosted Gitea (for personal + open source projects)**: [git.mahdium.ir/mahdium](https://git.mahdium.ir/mahdium)

## 🌐 Projects & Services

- #### 🧭 **My Website**: [mahdium.ir/en](https://mahdium.ir/en)
- #### 🧰 **My Public Services**: [services.mahdium.ir/en](https://services.mahdium.ir/en)

I run a few open source and privacy-conscious services. Feel free to explore.
